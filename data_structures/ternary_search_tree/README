<h1>Ternary Search Tree</h1>

Compiler -- G++ w/C++14 standard


This data structure combines the time efficiency of tries with the space efficiency of binary search trees. 

This data structure is good for storing strings and larger datasets when compared to other tree based search data-structures.

--Complexities-- [worst->best]
Search/Insert/Delete: O(n) -> O(log n)


is this a super over-engineered solution to a simple datastructure? probably...but I had fun and thats all that matters
